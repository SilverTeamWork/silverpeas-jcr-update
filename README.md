This library is to be hooked to the migration process of the JCR from Apache Jackrabbit 2 to Apache
Jackrabbit Oak.

It provides custom behaviours to the migration of the JCR from Apache Jackrabbit 2 to Apache Jackrabbit Oak.
For example, it creates the index definitions for the Silverpeas content in the JCR by using the Apache Jackrabbit Oak API.

For more information about the migration process, please read its documentation at 
[the Apache Jackrabbit Oak Repository migration page](https://jackrabbit.apache.org/oak/docs/migration.html).
